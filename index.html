			<article>
				<p>I worked as chief audio engineer for 4 years. I was quite lucky with getting the job, as someone was leaving I swooped right in =]. As you all may know, music means something to everybody, and everybody defines his or her own meaning to music. Music is noise and sounds organized in a way that brings comfort to our ears.</p><br>
				
				<p>While working I went to Mt.Sac Community college. I got into Berkeley, UC San Diego, UCSB, CSULB, CSULA, and CSUF, but ultimately choose CSULB. I was 2 courses away from finishing my required classes to be an accounting major, when I realize I didn't want to be an accountant. I like business, I like the social interaction and all the happenings of how a business functions, but I didn't want to be an accountant. So here I was, weeks away from 2012 Spring semester, with about a year left to go before I graduate and a couple more classes, and I was experiencing some mid-life crisis.  </p><br>

				<p>Instead of retreating into a corner in my fetal position, I had to do something. I jotted down some things I liked and concluded programming was high on the list. When I was a kid I made a website using geocities and thought, I could do it again! After countless hours of research I learned a bit about web development. I'm no seasoned pro, at best, an advance novice. I'm still learning, but if you're in this field, you know the pros are still learning as well. =]</p><br>
